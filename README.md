# Carpooling

SmartMiles: A Safer, Greener, Smarter Commute Optimizer Inspiration The inspiration for Smart Miles stems from a vision of creating a more sustainable and efficient transportation solution. With a focus on environmental consciousness and community collaboration, we aim to revolutionize daily commuting by fostering a culture of shared rides and eco-friendly travel.

What it does Smart Miles is a cutting-edge carpooling platform that seamlessly connects drivers and passengers with a shared commitment to greener, smarter travel. Through an intuitive web application built with ReactJS and Spring Boot, users can effortlessly coordinate rides, promoting resource efficiency and reducing carbon footprints.

How we built it Smart Miles was crafted with a tech stack designed for versatility and scalability. Leveraging ReactJS for a dynamic frontend and Spring Boot for a robust backend, our team employed AWS services (EKS, ECR, Certificate Manager, Route 53) for cloud infrastructure. Docker containers ensure consistent deployment across diverse environments, forming a cohesive and resilient solution.
